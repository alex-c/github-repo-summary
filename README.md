## Install

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Clone or download the repository, navigate to the repository's main directory, and install with `npm install`. Run it with `npm start` after successful installation - the page will be hosted at `localhost:3000`.

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `predeploy`: Called by `deploy`, calls `npm run build`.
- `deploy`: Deploys production build to Github pages.
